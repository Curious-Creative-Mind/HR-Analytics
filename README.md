# HR-Analytics

## Project Background/Overview:

This project aims at analyzing Human Resources (HR) related dataset of a fictional company based in USA.

By answering certain business questions, we’ll try to deep dive into employee composition, their salary, their qualifications, performance review, reasons for terminations etc. and come up with suggestions to improve employee satisfaction and improve their productivity thus contributing to company growth.

### Data Structure and Initial Checks:

The database structure consists of 3 tables as shown below : HR (90 records), Employees (90 records) and Department (7 records) .

Prior to beginning the analysis, a variety of checks were conducted for quality control and familiarization with the datasets using Ms Excel.

### Data Quality Check:

-	Check blanks
-	Valid data
-	Replaced blanks in cerain columns with blank values 

## Executive Summary:

### Overview of Findings:

- There is uneven distribution of employees in various departments with Development (47) and Finance (13 ) being the top 2 departments with maximum employees while Legal (1) having the lowest employee count.

-	The average age of emplyees is 41 yrs. while the average hiring age is 32 yrs.

-	Top 3 cities with highest average salary are Colorado ($4280.67), Alabama ($4218.40), Missouri ($4189.29) while New York ($3983.00) and Washington ($3977.33) are at bottom having the lowest average salary.

-	Resignation and Unfair Dismissal are the 2 most common reasons for termination of employees with 11 and 10 counts respectively.

-	The average salary of female employees is $4124.74, slightly higher than male employees ($4098.96) despite having similar average performance review (Female- 7.68 and Male- 7.64). This could be due to the company policy of encouraging  more female employees in the workforce as female employees constitute only 37.77 % of workforce.

-	Average tenure of employees who were terminated is 1.38 yrs.

-	Leyla , Manager of the Developmnent department had maximum number of employees (11 in count) terminated under her. One probable reason behind this could be that the  Developmet department has relatively higher no. of employees under it.

-	Top 5 cities with highest no. of female employees are Montana, Missouri, New York, Ohio (with 5 each) and Washington (4).

-	Administrative Assistant is the highest paid position in Finance/Accounting department with a salary of $4576 while the position of Lawyer within the Legal department is the most paid with the salary of $3698 which is comparatively very low as the salary of highest paid positions in other departments is more than $4200.

-	Educational qualification of top 5 highest paid employees is Majors, Higher Certificate and Bachelor’s completed. This shows that earning does not depend on qualification alone rather it involves other factors as well.

-	Aged employees with 60 and above age and young employees in the age group of 21-30 yrs. have very good average performance review. This could be attributed to the experience and expertise of aged employees while the high energy, enthusiasm and motivation of young employees.

-	The yearwise termination rate of employees from 2015-2019 seems to be consistent ranging from 4-6 while in case of hiring new employees, year 2016 saw maximum hirings (total 19) and 2017 saw lowest hirings (total 9). This could be due to the surplus hiring in the previous year(2016) as the average hiring rate per year is 13.

## Recommendations:

Based on the uncovered insights, the following recommendations have been provided:

-	Provide incentives to employees based on their performance.
  
-	Boost the morale and organize motivational sessions for middle aged employees especially targetting age group of 31-60 yrs..
  
-	Ensure no unfair dismissal by mandating managers to provide valid reasons for terminating employees under them. Also trying to understand the reason behind resignation of employees in order to retain good performing employees in the company.
  
-	Hire more young employees and train them to improve the productivity so as to reduce the average hiring age as well as overall average age of employees.
